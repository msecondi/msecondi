# 👋🏼 Hey, I'm Matthew Secondi

I'm a full-stack developer with a deep interest in mental health, human connection, and building meaningful digital experiences. I recently completed an intensive Software Engineering Bootcamp at BrainStation, where I primarily developed, but also designed, full-stack applications that blend functionality with empathy, storytelling, and thoughtful interaction.

## 🧠 What I Care About

- **Human-centered design** – I believe tech should feel intuitive, warm, and purposeful.
- **Self-inquiry & emotional expression** – My capstone app, *breathe*, helps users reflect and reconnect.
- **Bridging development with empathy** – I aim to write clean, scalable code without losing sight of the human on the other side of the screen.

## 🌱 Outside Tech

I’m also involved in 🎭 local theatre, 🏐 volleyball, and finding ways to grow as a person. I’m always up for a good conversation about purpose, design, or nature.

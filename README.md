# 👋 Hi, I'm Matthew Secondi

I'm a frontend developer with a deep interest in mental health, human connection, and building meaningful digital experiences. I recently completed an intensive Software Engineering Bootcamp at BrainStation, where I designed and developed full-stack applications that blend empathy, storytelling, and thoughtful interaction.

## 🧠 What I Care About

- **Human-centered design** – I believe tech should feel intuitive, warm, and purposeful.
- **Mental health & emotional expression** – My capstone app, *Breathe*, helps users reflect and reconnect.
- **Bridging development with empathy** – I aim to write clean, scalable code without losing sight of the human on the other side of the screen.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

**Languages & Tools:**  
JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, SCSS, MySQL, Git, REST APIs, Figma

**Currently Learning:**  
UX Design (in progress), TypeScript, accessibility best practices

## ✨ Projects

- 🔥 **[Breathe](https://github.com/msecondi/Breathe-Client)** – A mental health app that helps users process emotions through reflection and symbolic interaction.
- 🏆 **[Lululemon X BrainStation - Industry Project Winner](https://industryprojectteam1.netlify.app/)** - Collaborated with a team of data analysts and developers to deliver a client-facing front-end prototype for Lululemon, scaling community engagment and transforming siloed insights into meaningful, loyalty-building wellness experiences.

## 🌱 Outside Tech

I’m also involved in 🎭 local theatre, ♟️ chess clubs, and finding ways to bring more humanity into digital spaces. I’m always up for a good conversation about design, purpose, or a quiet hike under the stars.

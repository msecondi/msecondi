# 👋🏼 Hey, I'm Matthew Secondi

I’m a full-stack developer and certified UX designer with a focus on **human-centered applications**. I aim to build software that’s functional, empathetic, and meaningful. Recently, I completed BrainStation’s intensive Software Engineering Bootcamp and earned my UX Design certification, giving me a unique perspective at the intersection of development & design. My projects combine storytelling, clean code, and thoughtful interaction to create digital experiences that look to connect with people.

## 🧠 What Drives Me

- **Human-centered design** – I believe tech should feel intuitive, warm, and purposeful.
- **Self-inquiry & emotional expression** – My capstone app, *breathe*, helps users reflect, process and reconnect.
- **Bridging development with empathy** – I aim to write clean, scalable code without losing sight of the human on the other side of the screen.
